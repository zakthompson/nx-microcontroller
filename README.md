# NX Microcontroller

Use a microcontroller (Arduino Uno R3, Teensy 2.0++, etc.) as a Nintendo Switch controller. Stream your Switch gameplay remotely, record and playback macros, or build standalone automation bots.

^ _Playing my **real Switch** remotely on a Retroid Pocket 5 via streaming._

## Overview

This project provides two complementary tools for controlling a Nintendo Switch using LUFA-compatible microcontrollers:

### ðŸŽ® Controller Relay

A Windows application that captures XInput controller input and relays it to a microcontroller connected via USB serial. Perfect for:

- Remote gameplay streaming (combine with a capture card)
- Recording and replaying macros
- Creating automation sequences for grinding/farming

See [controller-relay/README.md](controller-relay/README.md) for details.

### ðŸ”§ Firmware

Custom firmware that makes your microcontroller appear as a Pro Controller to the Switch. Build in two modes:

- **Relay mode**: Accept input from the Controller Relay software via UART
- **Standalone mode**: Embed macros directly into the firmware to run without a PC

See [firmware/README.md](firmware/README.md) for details.

## Prerequisites

### Required

- **LUFA-compatible microcontroller**: Arduino Uno R3, Teensy 2.0++, or similar
  - Must have USB capabilities and be compatible with the LUFA framework

### Optional (for Controller Relay)

- **USB-to-UART adapter**: CP210x, FTDI, or CH340-based adapter
  - Required to communicate with the microcontroller in relay mode
  - Note: FTDI adapters may need [latency timer adjustments](https://projectgus.com/2011/10/notes-on-ftdi-latency-with-arduino/)
- **HDMI capture card**: USB-based capture card for streaming gameplay
  - Quality significantly impacts streaming performance
  - Must be compatible with standard capture software

## Quick Start

### For Remote Play with Controller Relay

1. Flash relay firmware to your microcontroller (see [firmware/README.md](firmware/README.md))
2. Connect microcontroller to Switch via USB
3. Connect microcontroller to PC via USB-to-UART adapter
4. Build and run Controller Relay (see [controller-relay/README.md](controller-relay/README.md))
5. Connect your XInput controller to PC

### For Standalone Macro Bot

1. Record a macro using Controller Relay (or write it by hand)
2. Build standalone firmware with embedded macro (see [firmware/README.md](firmware/README.md))
3. Flash to microcontroller
4. Plug microcontroller into Switch - macro runs automatically!
